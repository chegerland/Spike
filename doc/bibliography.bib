Our approach is based on the description of the length and attachment dynamics of actin filaments in the lamellipodium network. It is used to determine the total force exerted on the membrane at each position along the leading edge and at each time step. The model reproduces the marked state switches in protrusion morphodynamics found experimentally between epithelial cells in control conditions and cells expressing constitutively active Rac, a signaling molecule involved in the regulation of lamellipodium network assembly. The model also suggests a mechanistic explanation of experimental distortions in protrusion morphodynamics induced by deregulation of Arp2/3 and cofilin activity.},

  abstract = {Motile cells form lamellipodia in the direction of motion, which are flat membrane protrusions containing an actin filament network. The network flows rearward relative to the leading edge of the lamellipodium due to actin polymerization at the front. Thus, actin binding molecules are subject to transport towards the rear of the cell in the bound state and diffuse freely in the unbound state. We analyze this reaction\textendash{}diffusion\textendash{}advection process with respect to the concentration profiles of these species and provide an analytic approximation for them. Network flow may cause a depletion zone of actin binding molecules close to the leading edge. The existence of such zone depends on the free molecule concentration in the cell body, on the ratio of the diffusion length to the distance bound molecules travel rearward with the flow before dissociating, and the ratio of the diffusion length to the width of the region with network flow and actin binding. Our calculations suggest the existence of depletion zones for the F-actin cross-linkers filamin and {$\alpha$}-actinin in fish keratocytes (and other cell types), which is in line with the small elastic moduli of the F-actin network close to the leading edge found in measurements of the force motile cells are able to exert.},

Demographics, lifestyle, and depression were assessed with standardized questionnaires; height, weight, blood pressure, and random blood glucose (glucometer) were measured with standard protocol. The mean and standard deviation for age, body mass index, and Quran memorization were 63 years (7.5), 28.9 kg/m (4.8), and 4.3 sections (6.9). Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and depression were 71\%, 29\%, and 22\%, respectively. Those who memorized at least 10 sections of Quran were 64\%, 71\%, and 81\% less likely to have hypertension, diabetes, and depression compared to those who memorized less than 0.5 sections, after controlling for covariates. There was a strong linear association between Quran memorization and hypertension, diabetes, and depression indicating that those who had memorized a larger portion of the Quran were less likely to have one of these chronic diseases.

Previous work has shown that when a graphene layer is brought into contact with a dielectric material, a gap can appear in its electric band structure. This allows for the formation of TE-plasmons with unusual dispersion relations. In addition, if the dielectric has a finite thickness, graphene strongly modifies the behavior of the waveguiding modes by introducing dissipation above a well-defined cutoff frequency, thus providing the possibility of mode filtering. This cutoff and the properties of TE-plasmons are closely related to the pair-creation threshold of graphene, thus representing quantum mechanical effects that manifest themselves in the electromagnetic response.},

It renders generally valid expressions for both the forces between bodies and the forces on atoms in the presence of bodies, while showing very clearly the intimate relation between the different types of dispersion forces. By considering examples, the influence of various factors like form, size, electric and magnetic properties, or intervening media on the forces is addressed.

We show that the combination of nonequilibrium dynamics, anomalous Doppler effect and spin-momentum locking of light mediates an intriguing interplay between the atom's translational and rotational degrees of freedom. This behavior deeply affects the drag force in a way that is reminiscent of classical rolling friction. Our fully non-Markovian and nonequilibrium description highlights counterintuitive features characterizing the atom's velocity-dependent rotational dynamics and determining the strength of the frictional force. These results prompt interesting directions for tuning the interaction and for investigating non-equilibrium dynamics as well as the properties of confined light.},

Our formulation of the replica-symmetric ansatz shares the symmetries of that suggested in a seminal paper by Rodgers and Bray (symmetry with respect to permutation of replica and rotation symmetry in the space of replica), but uses a different representation in terms of superpositions of Gaussians. It gives rise to a pair of integral equations which can be solved by a stochastic population-dynamics algorithm. Remarkably our representation allows us to identify pure-point contributions to the spectral density related to the existence of normalizable eigenstates. Our approach is not restricted to matrices defined on graphs with Poissonian degree distribution. Matrices defined on regular random graphs or on scale-free graphs, are easily handled. We also look at matrices with row constraints such as discrete graph Laplacians. Our approach naturally allows us to unfold the total density of states into contributions coming from vertices of different local coordinations and an example of such an unfolding is presented. Our results are well corroborated by numerical diagonalization studies of large finite random matrices.},

  abstract = {This is a book for absolute beginners. If you have heard about random matrix theory, commonly denoted RMT, but you do not know what that is, then welcome!, this is the place for you. Our aim is to provide a truly accessible introductory account of RMT for physicists and mathematicians at the beginning of their research career. We tried to write the sort of text we would have loved to read when we were beginning Ph.D. students ourselves. Our book is structured with light and short chapters, and the style is informal. The calculations we found most instructive are spelt out in full. Particular attention is paid to the numerical verification of most analytical results. Our book covers standard material - classical ensembles, orthogonal polynomial techniques, spectral densities and spacings - but also more advanced and modern topics - replica approach and free probability - that are not normally included in elementary accounts on RMT. This book is dedicated to the fond memory of Oriol Bohigas.},

The nearest-neighbor spacing distribution of the adjacency matrix of this network follows Gaussian orthogonal statistics of random matrix theory (RMT). Spectral rigidity test follows random matrix prediction for a certain range and deviates afterwards. Eigenvector analysis of the network using inverse participation ratio suggests that the statistics of bulk of the eigenvalues of network is consistent with those of the real symmetric random matrix, whereas few eigenvalues are localized. Based on these IPR calculations, we can divide eigenvalues in three sets: (a) The nondegenerate part that follows RMT. (b) The nondegenerate part, at both ends and at intermediate eigenvalues, which deviates from RMT and expected to contain information about important nodes in the network. (c) The degenerate part with zero eigenvalue, which fluctuates around RMT-predicted value. We identify nodes corresponding to the dominant modes of the corresponding eigenvectors and analyze their structural properties.},

In large networks, elements of the synaptic connectivity matrix can be chosen randomly from appropriate distributions, making results from random matrix theory highly relevant.

Therefore, we compute eigenvalue spectra of large random matrices with excitatory and inhibitory columns drawn from distributions with different means and equal or different variances.},

We then present new results concerning different problems that arise in a financial context: (a) the generalisation of the MP result to the case of an empirical correlation matrix (ECM) constructed using exponential moving averages, for which we give a new elegant derivation (b) the specific dynamics of the `market' eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector, which defines an interesting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the unit sphere and (c) the problem of the dependence of ECM's on the observation frequency of the returns and its interpretation in terms of lagged cross-influences.},

  abstract = {It is common knowledge that any two firms in the economy are correlated. Even firms belonging to different sectors of an industry may be correlated because of ``indirect'' correlations. How can we analyze and understand these correlations? This article reviews recent results regarding cross-correlations between stocks. Specifically, we use methods of random matrix theory (RMT), which originated from the need to understand the interactions between the constituent elements of complex interacting systems, to analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of returns. We analyze 30-min returns of the largest 1000 US stocks for the 2-year period 1994\textendash{}1995. We find that the statistics of approximately 20 of the largest eigenvalues (2\%) show deviations from the predictions of RMT. To test that the rest of the eigenvalues are genuinely random, we test for universal properties such as eigenvalue spacings and eigenvalue correlations, and demonstrate that C shares universal properties with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. The statistics of the eigenvectors of C confirm the deviations of the largest few eigenvalues from the RMT prediction. We also find that these deviating eigenvectors are stable in time. In addition, we quantify the number of firms that participate significantly to an eigenvector using the concept of inverse participation ratio, borrowed from localization theory.},

  abstract = {We analyze the dynamics of networks of spiking neural oscillators. First, we present an exact linear stability theory of the synchronous state for networks of arbitrary connectivity. For general neuron rise functions, stability is determined by multiple operators, for which standard analysis is not suitable. We describe a general nonstandard solution to the multioperator problem. Subsequently, we derive a class of neuronal rise functions for which all stability operators become degenerate and standard eigenvalue analysis becomes a suitable tool. Interestingly, this class is found to consist of networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. For random networks of inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons, we then develop an analytical approach, based on the theory of random matrices, to precisely determine the eigenvalue distributions of the stability operators. This yields the asymptotic relaxation time for perturbations to the synchronous state which provides the characteristic time scale on which neurons can coordinate their activity in such networks. For networks with finite in-degree, i.e., finite number of presynaptic inputs per neuron, we find a speed limit to coordinating spiking activity. Even with arbitrarily strong interaction strengths neurons cannot synchronize faster than at a certain maximal speed determined by the typical in-degree.},

We explore the phenomenon of strong coupling with reference to a number of examples involving electromagnetic fields and matter. We then provide a concise description of the relevant background physics of surface plasmon polaritons. An extensive overview of the historical background and a detailed discussion of more recent relevant experimental advances concerning strong coupling between surface plasmon polaritons and quantum emitters is then presented. Three conceptual frameworks are then discussed and compared in depth: classical, semi-classical and fully quantum mechanical; these theoretical frameworks will have relevance to strong coupling beyond that involving surface plasmon polaritons. We conclude our review with a perspective on the future of this rapidly emerging field, one we are sure will grow to encompass more intriguing physics and will develop in scope to be of relevance to other areas of science.},

We then analyse the contribution of these waves in a variety of phenomena. They give a leading contribution to the density of electromagnetic states, they produce both temporal coherence and spatial coherence in the near field of planar thermal sources. They can be used to modify radiative properties of surfaces and to design partially spatially coherent sources. Finally, we discuss the role of surface waves in the radiative heat transfer and the theory of dispersion forces at the subwavelength scale.},

The analysis reveals a rich repertoire of states, including synchronous states in which neurons fire regularly; asynchronous states with stationary global activity and very irregular individual cell activity; and states in which the global activity oscillates but individual cells fire irregularly, typically at rates lower than the global oscillation frequency. The network can switch between these states, provided the external frequency, or the balance between excitation and inhibition, is varied. Two types of network oscillations are observed. In the fast oscillatory state, the network frequency is almost fully controlled by the synaptic time scale. In the slow oscillatory state, the network frequency depends mostly on the membrane time constant. Finite size effects in the asynchronous state are also discussed.},

  volume = {113},
  issn = {0031-9007, 1079-7114},
  abstract = {The popular bar prank known in colloquial English as beer tapping consists in hitting the top of a beer bottle with a solid object, usually another bottle, to trigger the foaming over of the former within a few seconds. Despite the trick being known for long time, to the best of our knowledge, the phenomenon still lacks scientific explanation. Although it seems natural to think that shock-induced cavitation enhances the diffusion of CO\$\_2\$ from the supersaturated bulk liquid into the bubbles by breaking them up, the subtle mechanism by which this happens remains unknown. Here we show that the overall foaming-over process can be divided into three stages where different physical phenomena take place in different time-scales, namely: bubble-collapse (or cavitation) stage, diffusion-driven stage and buoyancy-driven stage. In the bubble-collapse stage, the impact generates a train of expansion-compression waves in the liquid that leads to the fragmentation of pre-existing gas cavities. Upon bubble fragmentation, the sudden increase of the interface-area-to-volume ratio enhances mass transfer significantly, which makes the bubble volume grow by a large factor until CO\$\_2\$ is locally depleted. At that point buoyancy takes over, making the bubble clouds rise and eventually form buoyant vortex rings whose volume grows fast due to the feedback between the buoyancy-induced rising speed and the advection-enhanced CO\$\_2\$ transport from the bulk liquid to the bubble. The physics behind this explosive process might also be connected to some geological phenomena.},

  title = {Resonance Energy Transfer between Two Atoms in a Conducting Cylindrical Waveguide},
  volume = {98},
  abstract = {We consider the energy transfer process between two identical atoms placed inside a perfectly conducting cylindrical waveguide. We first introduce a general analytical expression of the energy transfer amplitude in terms of the electromagnetic Green's tensor; we then evaluate it in the case of a cylindrical waveguide made of a perfect conductor, for which analytical expressions of the Green's tensor exist. We numerically analyze the energy transfer amplitude when the radius of the waveguide is such that the transition frequency of both atoms is below the lower cutoff frequency of the waveguide, so that the resonant photon exchange is strongly suppressed. We consider both cases of atomic dipoles parallel and orthogonal to the axis of the guide. In both cases, we find that the energy transfer is modified by the presence of the waveguide. In the near zone, that is when the atomic separation is smaller than the atomic transition wavelength, the change, with respect to the free-space case, is small for axial dipoles, while it is larger for radial dipoles; it grows when the intermediate region between near and far zone is approached. In the far zone, we find that the energy transfer amplitude is strongly suppressed by the waveguide, becoming virtually zero. A physical interpretation of these results is discussed. Finally, we discuss the resonance interaction energy and force between two identical correlated atoms in the waveguide, one excited and the other in the ground state, prepared in their symmetric or antisymmetric superposition.},

  title = {Modified and Controllable Dispersion Interaction in a One-Dimensional Waveguide Geometry},
  volume = {91},
  abstract = {Dispersion interactions such as the van der Waals interaction between atoms or molecules derive from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and can be understood as the exchange of virtual photons between the interacting partners. Any modification of the environment in which those photons propagate will thus invariably lead to an alteration of the van der Waals interaction. Here we show how the two-body dispersion interaction inside a cylindrical waveguide can be made to decay asymptotically exponentially and how this effect sensitively depends on the material properties and the length scales of the problem, eventually leading to the possibility of controllable interactions. Further, we discuss the possibility to detect the retarded van der Waals interaction by resonant enhancement of the interaction between Rydberg atoms in the light of long-range potentials due to guided modes.},

The main thesis of this paper is that this universal scale is intrinsic to the slum-city system and is independent from external factors. By interpreting reaction and diffusion as long- and short-distance migration, our paper explains this universal length scale as resulting from a Turing instability of the interaction of two social groups: poor and rich.},

We also show that this transition can be reversed by modifying the dynamics of a few agents, deemed as game changers. Surprisingly, the optimal placement of these game changers is found to be in regions of maximum local crowd speed. The presence of such game changers is effective owing to the discontinuous nature of the underlying phase transition. Thus our generic approach provides strategies to (i) delay crowd crush and (ii) design safe evacuation procedures, two aspects that are of paramount importance in maintaining safety of mass gatherings of people.},

  abstract = {A compact and transparent plane-wave expansion of the complete Green function for an absorbing multilayered system is derived. The plane-wave solutions involved match, in the appropriate limit, the space-mode functions recently employed for quantization of the radiation field in a planar cavity and make this Green function particularly convenient for consideration of optical processes in realistic cavities and multilayers in general. This is illustrated by considering classically light scattering on a molecule in a planar cavity. It is demonstrated that the cross sections derived, besides generally describing light scattering on molecules embedded in a multilayer, correctly reproduce the effects of field confinement on light scattering in a planar cavity as predicted recently by the quantum-mechanical theory of Cairo et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 1413 (1993)]. It is also pointed out that scattering into waves guided by the cavity lossy (metallic) mirrors may become an effective process in low-order microcavities. As a by product, a classical approach to spontaneous emission in absorbing planar cavities emerges from these considerations.},

Inspired by the recent finding that dynamical corrections to such an atom's internal dynamics are enhanced by one order of magnitude for vertical motion\textemdash{}compared with the paradigmatic setup of parallel motion\textemdash{}we generalize quantum friction calculations to arbitrary angles between the atom's direction of motion and the surface in front of which it moves.

  title = {Hipsters on Networks: {{How}} a Minority Group of Individuals Can Lead to an Antiestablishment Majority},
  volume = {99},
  shorttitle = {Hipsters on Networks},
  abstract = {The spread of opinions, memes, diseases, and ``alternative facts'' in a population depends both on the details of the spreading process and on the structure of the social and communication networks on which they spread. One feature that can change spreading dynamics substantially is heterogeneous behavior among different types of individuals in a social network. In this paper, we explore how antiestablishment nodes (e.g., hipsters) influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products. We consider a model in which spreading follows a deterministic rule for updating node states (which indicate which product has been adopted) in which an adjustable probability pHip of the nodes in a network are hipsters, who choose to adopt the product that they believe is the less popular of the two. The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose which product to adopt by considering which products their immediate neighbors have adopted. We simulate our model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters have a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product: even when only one of the two products exists at the beginning of the simulations, a small fraction of hipsters in a network can still cause the other product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this behavior, we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fractions of the products on k-regular trees in the limit of few hipsters. Additionally, our simulations demonstrate that a time delay {$\tau$} in the knowledge of the product distribution in a population, as compared to immediate knowledge of product adoption among nearest neighbors, can have a large effect on the final distribution of product adoptions. Using a local-tree approximation, we derive an analytical estimate of the spreading of products and obtain good agreement if a sufficiently small fraction of the population consists of hipsters. In all networks, we find that either of the two products can become the more popular one at steady state, depending on the fraction of hipsters in the network and on the amount of delay in the knowledge of the product distribution. Our simple model and analysis may help shed light on the road to success for antiestablishment choices in elections, as such success\textemdash{}and qualitative differences in final outcomes between competing products, political candidates, and so on\textemdash{}can arise rather generically in our model from a small number of antiestablishment individuals and ordinary processes of social influence on normal individuals.},

  title = {Interspike Interval Correlations in Networks of Inhibitory Integrate-and-Fire Neurons},
  volume = {99},
  abstract = {We study temporal correlations of interspike intervals, quantified by the network-averaged serial correlation coefficient (SCC), in networks of both current- and conductance-based purely inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons. Numerical simulations reveal transitions to negative SCCs at intermediate values of bias current drive and network size. As bias drive and network size are increased past these values, the SCC returns to zero. The SCC is maximally negative at an intermediate value of the network oscillation strength. The dependence of the SCC on two canonical schemes for synaptic connectivity is studied, and it is shown that the results occur robustly in both schemes. For conductance-based synapses, the SCC becomes negative at the onset of both a fast and slow coherent network oscillation. We then show by means of offline simulations using prerecorded network activity that a neuron's SCC is highly sensitive to its number of presynaptic inputs.

  volume = {99},
  abstract = {Neurons process information by translating continuous signals into patterns of discrete spike times. An open question is how much information these spike times contain about signals which modulate either the mean or the variance of the somatic currents in neurons, as is observed experimentally. Here we calculate the exact information contained in discrete spike times about a continuous signal in both encoding strategies. We show that the information content about mean modulating signals is generally substantially larger than about variance modulating signals for biological parameters. Our analysis further reveals that higher information transmission is associated with a larger proportion of nonlinear signal encoding. Our study measures the complete information content of mean and variance coding and provides a method to determine what fraction of the total information is linearly decodable.},

  title = {Computational Model of the Mechanoelectrophysiological Coupling in Axons with Application to Neuromodulation},
  volume = {99},
  abstract = {For more than half a century, the action potential (AP) has been considered a purely electrical phenomenon. However, experimental observations of membrane deformations occurring during APs have revealed that this process also involves mechanical features. This discovery has recently fuelled a controversy on the real nature of APs: whether they are mechanical or electrical. In order to examine some of the modern hypotheses regarding APs, we propose here a coupled mechanoelectrophysiological membrane finite-element model for neuronal axons. The axon is modeled as an axisymmetric thin-wall cylindrical tube. The electrophysiology of the membrane is modeled using the classic Hodgkin-Huxley (H-H) equations for the Nodes of Ranvier or unmyelinated axons and the cable theory for the internodal regions, whereas the axonal mechanics is modeled by means of viscoelasticity theory. Membrane potential changes induce a strain gradient field via reverse flexoelectricity, whereas mechanical pulses result in an electrical self-polarization field following the direct flexoelectric effect, in turn influencing the membrane potential. Moreover, membrane deformation also alters the values of membrane capacitance and resistance in the H-H equation. These three effects serve as the fundamental coupling mechanisms between the APs and mechanical pulses in the model. A series of numerical studies was systematically conducted to investigate the consequences of interaction between the APs and mechanical waves on both myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Simulation results illustrate that the AP is always accompanied by an in-phase propagating membrane displacement of {$\approx$}1nm, whereas mechanical pulses with enough magnitude can also trigger APs. The model demonstrates that mechanical vibrations, such as the ones arising from ultrasound stimulations, can either annihilate or enhance axonal electrophysiology depending on their respective directionality and frequency. It also shows that frequency of pulse repetition can also enhance signal propagation independently of the amplitude of the signal. This result not only reconciles the mechanical and electrical natures of the APs but also provides an explanation for the experimentally observed mechanoelectrophysiological phenomena in axons, especially in the context of ultrasound neuromodulation.},

  abstract = {We study finite-size fluctuations in a network of spiking deterministic neurons coupled with nonuniform synaptic coupling. We generalize a previously developed theory of finite-size effects for globally coupled neurons with a uniform coupling function. In the uniform coupling case, mean-field theory is well defined by averaging over the network as the number of neurons in the network goes to infinity. However, for nonuniform coupling it is no longer possible to average over the entire network if we are interested in fluctuations at a particular location within the network. We show that if the coupling function approaches a continuous function in the infinite system size limit, then an average over a local neighborhood can be defined such that mean-field theory is well defined for a spatially dependent field. We then use a path-integral formalism to derive a perturbation expansion in the inverse system size around the mean-field limit for the covariance of the input to a neuron (synaptic drive) and firing rate fluctuations due to dynamical deterministic finite-size effects.},

  abstract = {Temporal correlations in neuronal spike trains are known to introduce redundancy to stimulus encoding. However, exact methods to describe how these correlations impact neural information transmission quantitatively are lacking. Here, we provide a general measure for the information carried by correlated rate modulations only, neglecting other spike correlations, and use it to investigate the effect of rate correlations on encoding redundancy. We derive it analytically by calculating the mutual information between a time-correlated, rate modulating signal and the resulting spikes of Poisson neurons. Whereas this information is determined by spike autocorrelations only, the redundancy in information encoding due to rate correlations depends on both the distribution and the autocorrelation of the rate histogram. We further demonstrate that at very small signal strengths the information carried by rate correlated spikes becomes identical to that of independent spikes, in effect measuring the signal modulation depth. In contrast, a vanishing signal correlation time maximizes information but does not generally yield the information of independent spikes. Overall, our study sheds light on the role of signal-induced temporal correlations for neural coding, by providing insight into how signal features shape redundancy and by establishing mathematical links between existing methods.},

It assumes of the reader an undergraduate background in mathematical methods typical of engineers and physicists, though many chapters begin with a descriptive summary. The book is also accessible to others who only require numerical recipes. The stochastic Taylor expansion provides the basis for the discrete time numerical methods for differential equations. The book presents many new results on high-order methods for strong sample path approximations and for weak functional approximations, including implicit, predictor-corrector, extra-polation and variance-reduction methods. Besides serving as a basic text on such methods, the book offers the reader ready access to a large number of potential research problems in a field that is just beginning to expand rapidly and is widely applicable. To help the reader to develop an intuitive understanding of the underlying mathematics and hand-on numerical skills, exercises and over 100 PC-Exercises are included.},

Thus, it is important to examine the occurrence and impact of sexual harassment on women in physics. A survey of undergraduate women, who attended a conference for undergraduate women in physics, revealed that approximately three quarters (74.3\%; 338/455) of survey respondents experienced at least one type of sexual harassment. This sample was recruited from a large fraction of undergraduate women in physics in the United States. We find that certain types of sexual harassment predict a negative sense of belonging and exacerbate the imposter phenomenon. The types of sexual harassment that predict these outcomes, both forms of gender harassment, while seemingly less severe types of harassment, have been found to have substantially negative personal and professional consequences. These findings are important since prior work has found that sense of belonging and the imposter phenomenon are related to students' persistence in STEM fields. Our results have implications for understanding and improving persistence in physics by informing the community about the occurrence of sexual harassment and its effects so that we can begin to work towards reducing its occurrence and mitigating its effects.},

  abstract = {Channel noise is the dominant intrinsic noise source of neurons causing variability in the timing of action potentials and interspike intervals (ISI). Slow adaptation currents are observed in many cells and strongly shape response properties of neurons. These currents are mediated by finite populations of ionic channels and may thus carry a substantial noise component. Here we study the effect of such adaptation noise on the ISI statistics of an integrate-and-fire model neuron by means of analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations. We contrast this stochastic adaptation with the commonly studied case of a fast fluctuating current noise and a deterministic adaptation current (corresponding to an infinite population of adaptation channels). We derive analytical approximations for the ISI density and ISI serial correlation coefficient for both cases. For fast fluctuations and deterministic adaptation, the ISI density is well approximated by an inverse Gaussian (IG) and the ISI correlations are negative. In marked contrast, for stochastic adaptation, the density is more peaked and has a heavier tail than an IG density and the serial correlations are positive. A numerical study of the mixed case where both fast fluctuations and adaptation channel noise are present reveals a smooth transition between the analytically tractable limiting cases. Our conclusions are furthermore supported by numerical simulations of a biophysically more realistic Hodgkin-Huxley type model. Our results could be used to infer the dominant source of noise in neurons from their ISI statistics.},
